Predicting Telecom Customer Churn with Behavioral Features.

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using behavioral, service usage, and billing features. 
The dataset contains 7,043 customers, split into 5,634 training records and 1,409 testing records.

The features include customer demographics, subscription details, service usage, and payment behavior, such as tenure, Contract, InternetService, TechSupport, StreamingTV, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges, with Churn as the target variable.

To prepare the data, several categorical variables were Label Encoded, including gender, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, PaperlessBilling, and Churn. Service-related features such as PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, and StreamingMovies were analyzed to understand their distribution and relationship with churn.

By combining customer behavior, service adoption, and billing information, this approach aims to identify patterns that explain why customers leave and help businesses design more effective retention strategies.
